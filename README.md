== TCF Labels

Sponsored by [Tracie's Community Farm][tracies_farm].

This is a Rails application designed to load data from an Excel file
and generate labels. These could be used for mailing labels, but the
specific purpose of these labels are to hang on baskets for delicious
locally grown food from Tracie's farm.

I know you're thinking, "Why didn't you use a MS Word mail merge?"
Well I did at first, but if you've ever tried to do anything more complicated
than just layout a name and address, you'll know MS Word mail merges are
awkwardly limited and ultimately annoyingly fragile. So lets do something
more robust and fun ... lets write a Rails app!
